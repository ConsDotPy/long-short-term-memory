# Long Short Term Memory
A simple implementation of LSTM from scratch in Python, then dump trained parameters to a .coe file, the goal is load data to FPGA RAMs. The parameters can be loaded and used to predict the next character in a sequence.  

The code is based on the [blog post](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah.
